<p><strong>Cookies &amp; Pixel Tracking</strong><br>
We may use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, log files and similar technologies to recognize you and your access privileges on this Website, to facilitate the interaction between you and this Website or the Application, and to track usage. We do not consider any of the information we collect through such technologies to be personal information, except where such information is deemed to be personal information by applicable law.

Third parties (including, but not limited to, advertising companies who serve ads on the Website and Application or elsewhere across the Internet) may also place cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, log files and other similar technologies on your computer or device when you visit our Website or use our Application, and you may also receive cookies from these other parties by virtue of accessing their web sites – we do not control any of these third-party cookies or other technologies. </p>

However, if you refuse the cookies from this Website or the Application, you may find that some services do not function properly. </p>
<p><strong>Behavior Tracking &amp; Analytic Tools</strong><br>
We collect information about your activities on our Website and through our Application over time, and we associate this information with you personally or your device for purposes of enabling and administering the functionality of the Website and the Application for you and for sending you location-based communications (which could include advertising for goods and services available from or through us, including products and services offered by third parties).

<p>We also use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereinafter "reCAPTCHA") on our Websites. This service is provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our Websites (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google. The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place. Data processing is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) DSGVO. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam. For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please visit the following links: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" style="display: inline;">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha" target="_blank" style="display: inline;">https://www.google.com/recaptcha</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Laws</strong><br>
Now and in the future there may be laws that apply to the use of websites and applications for behavioral or location-based tracking. The web browser you use may even have a “do not track” (or similar) setting. We, however, have not adopted processes to address those settings or other “do not track” requests, and consequently, do not limit or block your access to and use of our Website or Application. If you are not comfortable, your only practical option at this time is to not use the Website or Application. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In all cases, it is our intent to fully comply with “do not track” laws to the extent they are applicable to us and to our Website and Application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 6pt; text-align: justify;"><strong>Aggregate and Blind Data</strong><br>
This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of information that does not identify you and that is not considered “personally identifiable” pursuant to applicable law. We may use information from which your personally identifiable information has been removed or obscured for any purpose, in aggregate form or otherwise. We collect and use such information for a variety of purposes and may provide such information to third parties without restriction. </p>
<p><strong>This Policy Does Not Apply to Third Party Websites That Are Linked From The Website</strong><br>
This policy only applies to Company &nbsp;Websites and the Application. As described above, we may share information obtained from Company Websites with our affiliates or other third parties. While we expect that these affiliates or others will respect your privacy in a manner consistent with our policies, we cannot guarantee that they will do so.&nbsp;</p>

By submitting your credit application, you have consented for Company or one or more lending institutions to investigate your credit and employment history as described in detail at the bottom of such credit applications. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you submit a credit application to Company, Company and lending institutions may collect nonpublic personal information about you from your credit applications, other forms you provide, details regarding your prior transactions with the party collecting such information, and consumer reporting agencies.&nbsp;</p>
